# RetroGradeEmulator
RetroGradeEmulator is a lightweight, deployable web application that lets users play ROMs from a browser. It was forked from the Emul8Me Project. Right now it supports NES, SNES, and GBA. You will need to have ROMs in the appropriate format: .nes, .sfc, and .gba.

## Why do we need it?
Browsers have become state of the art applications. Many apps available on app stores can be made with wider compatibility for fractions of the code-base and energy. 

## Due-Outs
- Support for touch screens
- Support for PS1 and PSP
